# EfficientEdit

## About

EfficientEdit is an innovative inference acceleration technique that leverages edit-oriented speculative decoding to accelerate code editing tasks. Demonstrating remarkable performance gains, the method achieves up to 8× speedup on Qwen2.5-Coder-32-Instruct and 13× acceleration on DeepSeek-Coder-33B-Instruct models.
